# HFT Simulator

This is a simple High-Frequency Trading (HFT) simulator implemented in Java. The simulator allows you to perform automated trading operations based on predefined strategies and market conditions. I have used Market Making Algorithm and have calculated certain Adjustments based on variable previousTradingVolume

## Overview

The HFT Simulator is designed to execute trading cycles for multiple stocks based on provided market prices, buy quantities, sell quantities, and previous trading volumes. It calculates adjusted buy and sell prices, tracks profits for each cycle, and provides the total profit at the end of the simulation.

## Features

- Automated trading cycles for multiple stocks
- Adjustment of buy and sell prices based on market conditions
- Tracking of profits for each cycle
- Calculation of total profit for the entire simulation

## Usage

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
4. Modify the code to customize the trading parameters, such as buy quantities, sell quantities, market prices, and previous trading volumes for each stock.
5. Run the `main` method in the `HFTsimulator` class to execute the simulation.
6. The program will prompt you to enter the required parameters for each stock.
7. After the simulation completes, it will display the traded quantities, market prices, cycles, and the total profit.
